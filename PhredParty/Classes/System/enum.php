     * **A value of this type is simply an integer.**
     *
     * The word "enum" is short for "enumerand". Enumerands are used to represent an item in some enumeration, which
     * can be a list of available options, a range of data types etc. From the PHP's viewpoint, enumerands are
     * integers that, within an enumeration, usually start with `0` and increment by one with every subsequent
     * enumerand.
     *
     * Just like with integers, you would use `==` operator to compare two enumerands.
